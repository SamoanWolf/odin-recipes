This is my first project called Odin-recipes(HTML)

The process I went throught:
1. Added Index.html acting as homepage
2. Added 5 recipe page
3. Added images to the page
4. Added unordered list for ingredients
5. Added ordered list for directions
6. Linked all the pages together

HTML boiler-plate is used in all pages
